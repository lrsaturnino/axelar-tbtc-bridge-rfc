= Cross-Chain tBTC Minting and Redemption Flow

== L1 (Ethereum Mainnet) Setup:
- Implement a "Global Ledger" contract that keeps track of all tBTC minted across all chains.
- Create an "L2 Minting Allowance" system within this contract.

== L2 Setup:
- Implement a wtBTC contract that can mint tokens based on approved requests.
- Create a "Minting Request" contract that interfaces with Axelar.

== Axelar Integration:
- Use Axelar for cross-chain communication between L1 and L2s.

== Process Flow:

=== L2 Minting Request:
- User initiates a minting request on L2.
- The L2 Minting Request contract sends this request to L1 via Axelar.

=== L1 Approval:
- The Global Ledger contract on L1 receives the request.
- It checks if there's sufficient unminted tBTC allowance.
- If approved, it updates the global ledger and sends an approval message back to L2 via Axelar.

=== L2 Minting:
- The L2 contract receives the approval.
- It mints the corresponding amount of wtBTC to the user.

=== Periodic Reconciliation:
- Regularly (e.g., daily), aggregate all L2 minting data on L1.
- Mint the corresponding amount of canonical tBTC on L1 to match the total wtBTC minted across all L2s.
- This tBTC is held in a special contract as backing for all wtBTC.

=== Redemption Process:
- When a user wants to redeem wtBTC for actual BTC:
  a. They burn wtBTC on L2.
  b. This triggers a message to L1 via Axelar.
  c. L1 processes the redemption using the canonical tBTC redemption process.
